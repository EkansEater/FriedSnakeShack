This repository was built to be used as a "FastDL server"

Used this video for reference:

Would like to thank the Fried Chicken Shack, Leon, and the guy that made this YouTube video.

So what we have built here is the directory tree matching what we have in the server with the appropriate files that are needed for online custom multiplayer.
This allows for other players to play on your server and have a decent enough download/upload speed so that it's actually playable with custom maps.

The game we're customizing here is: Goldeneye: Source Mod.

It starts with the 'gesource/' directory. This directory branches off into the other directories made to hold other custom files.
You'll see we have a folder for maps and other things. 

We've included maps like "Haunted Mansion" and skins like "Scorpion" and "Deadpool". More to be added soon.
